/**
 * The queen: slides along both the straight and the diagonal directions.
 *
 * <p>A queen moves like a rook and a bishop combined, and Java's single
 * inheritance will not let it extend both. That limitation is worth sitting
 * with, because the instinct it provokes — "then let me borrow their direction
 * tables" — is the wrong one. An earlier version of this class did exactly
 * that, deriving its eight directions from {@code Rook.DIRECTIONS} and
 * {@code Bishop.DIRECTIONS}. It worked, and it was clever, and it cost more
 * than it saved:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>both sibling classes had to loosen their tables from {@code private} to
 *       package-private, so a detail of how a rook moves became visible to
 *       every class in the package;
 *   <li>the arrays were <em>shared</em>, not copied — Java arrays cannot be made
 *       immutable, so any one of the three classes could have scribbled on data
 *       the other two depend on;
 *   <li>and a reader asking the simple question "which way does a queen move?"
 *       had to open two other files to find out.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Eight literal pairs answer that question on sight, and they do not couple
 * this class to anything. Duplication is not free, but it is cheaper here than
 * the coupling it would have bought us — which is the judgement call the DRY
 * principle actually asks you to make, rather than the reflex it is often
 * mistaken for.
